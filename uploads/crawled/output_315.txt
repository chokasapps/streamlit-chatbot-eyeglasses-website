#  Marc Jacobs Sunglasses

The highly successful Marc Jacobs sunglasses collection contains ten feminine
and four unisex designs in plastic, metal and metal/plastic combinations.
Almost every style you can imagine is included: sexy cat eyes, a nod to the
past with retro octagons, rectangles and chunky double-bridge aviators.  Marc
Jacobs glasses  and Marc Jacobs sunglasses can all be customized with
prescription lenses  . Marc Jacobs  sunglasses  details include temples
sporting forked openwork, metal trim between the front and temples, and the
signature metal padlock, hinging the front with the actual temples. Colors
range from red and opal turquoise combined with gray lenses and such tri-color
treatments as blue/white/beige in the acetates to shades of red, white, blue,
gold, ruthenium and rhodium in the metals. The Marc Jacobs sunglasses
collection is a virtual rainbow of style with nods to his award-winning runway
fashions. The lines are clean, the details are refined, and the quality is as
highly regarded as his other fashion lines. You are in good company when you
put on a pair of sunglasses with the name of one of the most desired and
highly regarded fashion designers in the world.
