#  Dolomiti Eyewear Sunglasses

In the eastern Alps of Italy, near the Austrian border and a short drive from
Venice, the Dolomiti mountains spring from the ground. In the valleys live
artisans who for over one hundred years have been crafting fine eyewear by
hand. Steeped in the Venetian decorative tradition, and the Northern Italian
instinct for fine quality, Dolomiti Eyewear designs stay true to their
origins. Classic styles have a smooth design that have withstood the test of
time: And we have assembled a  Vintage sunglasses collection  as well. Oval
and  round glasses  frames bring balance and harmony to the face. Frames are
made with Alpaca, an alloy that is 82% copper, bringing many known healing
benefits to the body. Every component of the frame is 100% made and assembled
in Italy. All  Dolomiti Eyewear  frames are coated with 20 layers of Swiss
shellac, which provides a durable hypoallergenic barrier.  Dolomiti glasses
and Dolomiti **** sunglasses can all be customized with  **prescription
lenses** , just like all of our  sunglasses  . And, get free lenses too! (use
code FREELENS39) at checkout.
