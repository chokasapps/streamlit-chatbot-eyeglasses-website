##  Dolomiti Eyewear RC1 Polarized Sunglass Clips Glasses

###

  * Made of metal, the eyewear frame can be easily adjusted for a perfect fit with your prescription lenses. Your Dolomiti Eyewear purchase includes free standard shipping charges, and manufacturer packaging. You can add doctor verified prescription lenses, add custom polarized lenses, and many other lens options if you desire them. Like all Dolomiti Eyewear products, these eyeglasses frames provide the sophisticated and classic look that we all need. 
  * Dolomiti Eyewear RC1 Polarized Sunglass Clips eyeglass frame features a trendy round shape, which helps to balance rectangular face features. Frame shape is the most noticeable feature of a pair of glasses, followed by frame colors and frame size. Top brands always have a large collection of rectangle frame shape glasses, as well as oval frame shape glasses. 
  * Dolomiti Eyewear RC1 Polarized Sunglass Clips frames feature a fashionable full frame design, which is the largest component of designer eyeglasses brands collections. A rim all the way around the lenses, provides for maximum stability and durability. 
  * 2-year warranty. The warrantee by the manufacturer covers manufacturer's defects for the frame. As an online optical superstore, we can help to process a warrantee for you with the manufacturer, according to their return policy. 

Sunglass clips only (frame not included) for the RC1/S, RC1/C, and RC1/P round
glasses frames. The clips are polarized to cut glare effectively around the
water and while driving. Clips are available in shiny gold with brown lenses,
or shiny silver with grey lenses, and you can mix and match them to any color
of RC1 eyeglasses frames.

##  Dolomiti Eyeglasses

In the eastern Alps of Italy, near the Austrian border and a short drive from
Venice, the Dolomiti mountains spring from the ground. In the valleys live
artisans who for over one hundred years have been crafting fine eyewear by
hand. Steeped in the Venetian decorative tradition, and the Northern Italian
instinct for fine quality, we work directly with the same factories making top
designer brands, to bring you this same craftsmanship **at half the price** .
And we have assembled a  Vintage Collection  as well.
