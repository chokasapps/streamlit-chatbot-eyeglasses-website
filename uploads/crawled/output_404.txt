#  Ralph Lauren Glasses

Ralph Lauren glasses frames are created by a brand that is recognized
throughout the world. Ralph Lauren glasses found their beginning 40 years ago
with a collection of men’s ties. His Polo Ralph Lauren eyewear brand has since
grown into an iconic design philosophy that redefines an American style that
reflects a sense of timeless luxury. This design philosophy extends throughout
not only in Ralph Lauren’s glasses fashion lines for men, women, and children,
but also in their home décor that encompasses table top, bedding and bath
products. For more than 30 years, the reputation and distinctive images of the
Ralph Lauren life style have been consistently developed across an expanding
number of products, brands and international markets. The essence and
personality of the Polo brand is translated into everything that this leading
designer produces including  Ralph Lauren  glasses for men and women.
According to the designer, “Style is very personal. It has nothing to do with
fashion. Fashion is over quickly. Style is forever.” ...  Read More
