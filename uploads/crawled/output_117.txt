#  Chakra Eyewear Sunglasses

The staff at Eyeglasses.com has created the Chakra Eyewear sunglasses
collection with the intention of finding sunglasses that offer something
unique. Every sunglasses frame is unique in its own way, but all frames are
good quality with a very attractive price point for the quality level. These
are our favorite "picks."

  

Chakra Eyewear is available in a variety of shapes, colors, and other
reminders that our bodies should always be in a state of harmony, peace, and
perfection. "Chakra" is the Sanskrit word meaning "wheel", and it refers to
the energy centers in our body. Many Chakra Eyewear glasses are round, or
nearly round, as a reminder of the harmony and balance that is inherent in our
bodies.
