PiWear  is for the variable you. Humans are complex, multi-dimensional, always
changing. The visual execution of PiWear round  glasses  demonstrates that
variability. These  round glasses  , being a constant/classic, look great
regardless of changes in your mood and expression. Balance, intelligence,
style. Don't be afraid. Show your strength. For every pair of PiWear glasses
or  eyewear  that you purchase, we donate an eye surgery to a blind person, so
they can see again. There are over 30 million people in India alone with
preventable blindness. When you cause a blind person to see with the purchase
of PiWear eyeglasses, you are helping not only one person but an entire family
and community.
