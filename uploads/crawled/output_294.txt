#  Life Is Good Glasses

Life Is Good sunglasses come from the brand that was founded by "One van, two
brothers, and three simple words: Life Is Good." In 1994, after five years of
struggle, Bert and John Jacobs designed their first Life is Good t-shirt, and
discovered how those three simple words could help people to focus on the
good. Life Is Good sunglasses are founded on the same principle. The
collection includes the same fashionable shapes and stylish colors that you
might find in much more expensive, Italian-made  eyewear  . But with this
difference: the effect is happy, not somber, joyful and playful. The popular
sunglasses collection takes advantage of its heritage with some classic frame
styles but it also winks at a new contemporary dynamism.  Life Is Good eyewear
is the ideal choice for men or women with a self-confident attitude who know
what they want - Joy. All Life Is Good glasses and most  Life Is Good
sunglasses  can be customized with  **prescription lenses** , just like all of
our  glasses  and  sunglasses  .
