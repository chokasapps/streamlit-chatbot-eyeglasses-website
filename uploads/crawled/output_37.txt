##  Quality Brands Rule

The most reliable determinant of eyewear brands quality is the feel of them in
your hand. Do they rattle? Do they feel stiff and solid? When you exercise the
hinges do they move smoothly and with the same friction throughout the bend? A
better quality name brand eyeglasses frame has a higher level of machined
perfection, so that the better quality parts fit together well.  Cheap
eyeglasses  will fail, break, let you down, and help you see poorly, and the
top brands do not want that experience connected to their brand, so they make
sure that better quality materials and workmanship go into their  sunglasses
and eyeglasses. If you stick with name brands sunglasses and glasses frames -
and avoid the hyped-up new internet cheap glasses frames brands - you will be
much happier, more efficient, and more successful in your daily life.

  

Almost all the major fashion designers now has a line of designer eyewear and
prescription eyewear, for example  Tom Ford  . There are also some high
fashion brands that are eyewear-specialty companies, like  Modo  and
Silhouette  . A top brand will usually provide a wide selection of sunglasses,
with sunglasses lenses, prescription eyewear suitable for a wide selection of
lenses needs, in a variety of styles, all of which will provide good vision.

  

###  Leading Eyewear Manufacturers

The world's leading brands all make good quality eyewear. You will find these
on offer at eyeglass stores at more than double the prices of Eyeglasses.com.
This would include  Luxottica  (  Ray Ban eyewear  ,  Oakley eyewear  ,
Versace eyewear  ,  Polo eyewear  , and many others),  Safilo Group  (
Carrera eyewear  ,  Kate Spade eyewear  ,  Hugo Boss eyewear  , and many
others),  Kering Group  (  Gucci eyewear  ),  Marcolin Group  (  Tom Ford  ,
Kenneth Cole  ,  Guess  eye wear and others), and  Marchon Eyewear  (  Calvin
Klein  ,  Salvatore Ferragamo  ,  DKNY  and others). There are many other
quality makers of eyewear, including  Aspex eyewear  , and  Revolution eyewear
, which are the leaders in  clip on sunglasses  .

  

##  Global Production

Eyewear brands are manufactured all over the world, and it is not easy to
determine which country they were made in.

  

###  100% Italian Made

Consider glass frame design _model A_ : using German hinges and Italian
Mazzucchelli  zyl, which is considered the best, results in an excellent
quality European glasses frame.

  

###  50% Italian, 50% China

Yet this same frame design _model A_ could instead use Mazzucchelli zyl from
China (same company, different factory), Chinese hinges, and be assembled in a
Chinese factory. The Chinese frame would be very difficult to differentiate
from the original, except that it would be designated Made in China.

  

###  More Confusion

Now, let's say that this same frame _model A_ used Mazzucchelli zyl from
China, and Chinese hinges, but was assembled in Italy, it would be called
Italian eyewear, Made in Italy. Most European eyewear nowadays (except for a
few high end brands) that is made in Europe is made mostly of Chinese
components. You can understand why determining glasses frame quality is so
difficult.

  

###  **Chinese Eyewear Quality**

Nowadays, about 90% of all eyewear brands are made in China. All of the major
Italian glasses frame companies have moved the majority of their production to
China. Many of the eyeglasses that are made in China are then shipped to
Europe where a minimal amount of assembly or finishing work is done so that
the glasses frames can receive the Made in Europe designation. There are some
designers, like  Lafont  , and  Silhouette  and a few others that make their
glasses frames completely in Europe. Brands like  Armani  ,  Gucci  , and
other big fashion houses are mostly made in China, and then finished in
Europe. This is not to say that China eyewear is of inferior quality. China
has been making eyewear products for many years and the quality is quite good.

  

###  **Hinge Quality**

Hinges are a small but very important component in the overall quality of your
glasses frame. If the hinge is not mounted on the frame properly, it will
disengage which leads to a very difficult (or impossible) repair job. Low
quality hinges will wear out, the screw will pop out and get lost, and they
will wear quickly leading to rattling or sloppy action. Good quality hinges
have a smooth and consistent action that does not wear over time, with
friction that is consistent throughout the entire range of motion.

  

##  History

"Eyewear" is a term that describes  glasses  , sunglasses, lenses and anything
else that is used to cover the eyes either for protection, better vision,
fashion, or a combination of all three. Eyewear is normally dispensed at a
glasses store or a sports shop (in the case of sunglasses). Now you can buy
the same designer glasses with the same high-quality  prescription lenses  at
Eyeglasses.com, just like you can in eyeglasses stores. Nowadays, many people
are buying  prescription sunglasses  and  eyeglasses online  , in order to
save money and get a bigger selection.

  

Eyewear brands and eyewear dates back to Roman times. According to  Wikipedia
, one of the earliest evidences of the use of prescription eyewear is found in
the 1352 portrait painted by the Italian painter, Tommaso da Modena, of the
Dominican Cardinal Hugh of Saint-Cher who was a renowned biblical scholar.
Another example, this time an apostle wearing a type of reading glasses, is
found in the central panel from an altarpiece painted by Conrad von Soest in
1403, Bad Wildungen, Germany. Surprisingly, the basic design of glasses has
not changed in over 2000 years - a frame, sitting mostly on the ears and nose
(there are exceptions), positions lenses in front of the eyes so the wearer
can see better.

  

##  **Eyewear Frame Materials**

###  Celulose Acetate, aka "Zyl"

"Zyl" is a short name for the material  cellulose acetate  , which is made of
wood flakes, cottonseed fibers, stabilizers and plasticizers. Zyl is the most
common plastic frame material because it can assume a large array of colors,
textures, styles, and patterns. Temples and frame fronts can be cut from
blocks of zyl extruded as a sheet of block acetate. Or, granular zyl can be
liquefied and then injection molded. Block-cut zyl is stronger and more
stable, while injection molded zyl is less stable and less expensive. With
daily use in warm temperatures, zyl can shift and lose its form. Some
manufacturers choose to add metal cores in the temples to strengthen and
stabilize the frame.

  

###  **Monel**

Monel  is composed of about two-thirds nickel and one-third copper. This
highly ductile alloy can be hammered into a variety of different shapes
without losing strength. It resists stress well and is often used to stabilize
frame bridges and endpieces. Monel colors well, is corrosion resistant, and
durable. If you have an allergy to some metals, it is usually the nickel in
the metal that causes allergic reactions.

  

###  **Titanium**

Titanium  is extremely lightweight and will not rust, making it a  very
popular  and relatively new material for eyewear frames. Titanium's strength
allows it to be made thin, but it is hard to solder or weld and is expensive.
Titanium is a more expensive metal composite used in eye glasses frames known
for its beneficial qualities of strength, lightness, and flexibility. However,
titanium is very difficult to color so titanium frames usually come in very
restricted color options. Eyeglass frames that are 100% titanium are also a
hypo-allergenic--they don't contain any nickel which causes allergic reactions
in some people.

  

###  **Stainless Steel**

Stainless steel  is comprised mostly of iron, with a mixture of nickel,
manganese, and chromium. Stainless steel is highly lustrous, and makes  a good
thin and sturdy eye glasses frames  with strong corrosion resistance. Although
it is hard to make eye glasses frames with stainless steel due to soldering
and welding difficulties, stainless steel temples are especially springy.

  

###  **Nylon**

Nylon  is virtually unbreakable, so it is often the perfect choice for sports
and safety applications. Nylon is lightweight and flexible, but can only
accept opaque colors. Nylon is a soft material, so it scratches easily, and is
used in many low-cost,  low-quality eyeglass frame  and sunglasses
applications.

  

###  **Nickel Silver, Alpaca, German Silver**

Sometimes called "Alpaca" or "German Silver",  nickel silver  is rigid
compared to other more malleable metals. Nickel silvers contain more than 50%
copper, 25% nickel, and the rest zinc (no silver at all). Copper adds
pliability, zinc adds strength, and nickel gives it its namesake color, a
whitish appearance, because when the nickel content exceeds 12% the copper
color no longer shows through. Although the metal is lustrous, its brittleness
makes it a poor choice for slender frame fronts and nose pads. Thus, it is
better designed for use in hinges, endpieces, bridges and ornamental trims, as
well as an inner core for temples.

  

###  **Flexon**

Flexon  is a trade name for one company's flexible eyeglasses frames material.
Flexible eyeglass frames are available in many compositions, but the goal is
always the same. This kind of material is used in eyeglass frames in order to
reduce breakage. It is normally found in the shaft of the temple and in the
bridge, and it allows these areas to endure tremendous twisting without
breakage or permanent distortion of the frames shape.
