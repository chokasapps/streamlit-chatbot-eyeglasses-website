Most doctors will not measure your PD unless you ask, so be sure to ask for it and write it down on your prescription. If that is not convenient, you can call the store that last made glasses for you, they should have that on file. Follow this link to learn  How To Measure Your PD  . 
  * _ _ Single Vision, Progressive lenses, or Bifocal Lenses? Check out our  Lenses Page  to learn more about the best glasses lenses for your needs. You can easily make  blue light  blocking glasses by adding blue light treatment to block out harmful blue light.

your new prescription glasses. After we receive your package, we will call you

###  Eyeglasses Fit

Eyeglasses fit  begins with "Do you like the way the prescription glasses look
on your face?" If you like the way the eyeglasses look on your face, and the
frames are comfortable, then you will have perfect vision and you don't need
to do anything else. If the glasses are not comfortable or are slightly
crooked your vision could be impacted, an optical professional can make minor
adjustments to the bridge, nosepads, and temples to customize the eyewear to
the uniqueness of your face. If you have a stronger prescription, we strongly
recommend that you have your eyeglasses fitted by an eyewear professional.

###  Finding The Right Size Eyeglasses For You

The easiest and fastest way to find the right size prescription glasses online
for you to wear is to use your current glasses as a benchmark. Once you know
the size of your current glasses, you have a frame of reference for a new pair
of glasses. So let's say for example that your glasses have this size:
50-20-145. You can now use the Advanced Search function to search for
eyeglasses with a similar size. When you do the search, search the eye size
range 49-51, and search the bridge range 18-22, and do not search the temple
size. Temple size is really not important except in very special cases.
Searching a range of sizes is important because it vastly increases the number
of results you will get, and also the difference in sizes will be almost
unnoticeable compared to your current eyeglasses. After this, you can easily
buy glasses online, or reading glasses, or whatever you need.

Search Glasses

###  How To Measure Glasses Frame Size

There are two ways to measure eyeglasses frame size:

1) Read the tiny lettering on the inside of your glasses. Sometimes the
lettering has worn off, or it is too small for you to see even with a
magnifying glass. In which case you'll need to

2) Measure your glasses with a millimeter ruler. The eye size is measured from
one side of the lens to the other, horizontally, at the widest points. The
bridge size is the distance between the lenses at the closest point. The
temple size is measured from the tip to the hinge, including the bend.

Almost all eyeglass frames are designed so they can be adjusted. You can take
your eyeglass frames to a local optical professional or vision center for an
adjustment or read more about  adjusting your eyeglasses  .

###  Try On Glasses

Eyeglasses.com  pioneered the Virtual Try On VTO system for prescription
glasses on the internet with two patents issued in 2003. You can use the
virtual try on system on this website by looking for the VTO Icon. About half
of the frames in our catalog have VTO images, and you can try those by going
to the product detail page. There is a model wearing the eyeglasses, but
through the application on that page you can upload your own photo - so easy!

The great feature about this system is that after you input your pupillary
distance measurement, the system shows you an accurate representation of the
size of the eyeglasses frames on your own face. Unlike a shirt that you cannot
change to fit your body, glasses can be adjusted to fit your face.

###  Glasses Frames And Your Face Shape

Facial coloring and  face shape  are two important factors to consider when
choosing appropriate prescription glasses frames. The first step is to
determine your face shape (oval, round, rectangular, etc). Frame shapes can be
used to accentuate or de-accentuate your facial features, depending on how you
choose to express your personality. For example, if your face is basically
round, round glasses would reinforce that look, and rectangular glasses would
reduce the roundness of your face. Frame coloring works the same way; you
choose the frame color to either match or contrast with skin and hair tone,
eye color, jewelry, and clothing colors. The degree to which you match or
contrast will contribute to the expression of your personality and your look.

###  Eyeglasses For Face Shape

The shape of your eyeglasses frames can complement the shape of your face. If
you want a new pair of designer frames, then your new glasses should
complement your face. To understand how eyeglasses shapes can affect your
face, begin by understanding the fundamentals of face shape. While most faces
are a combination of shapes and angles, there are six basic face shapes. Below
are descriptions of these face shapes and guidelines for which type of glasses
frames work well for each.

_ _

###  Round Face

A round face shape has curvalinear lines with the width and length in the same
proportions and no angles. Your goal is to make the face appear longer and
thinner. Look for angular, narrow glasses frames that will lengthen the face;
high or mid-height temples, which help create a longer profile; a clear bridge
that widens the eyes; colored temples to add width; and order glasses frames
that are wider than they are deep, such as an octagonal shape.

_ _

###  Square Face

A square face shape is characterized by a strong jaw line and a broad forehead
- the face width and length are in the same proportions. Your goal should be
to make the face look longer and soften the angles. Look for curvilinear,
narrow style glasses that soften facial angles; glasses frames that are wider
than the widest part of the face; eyeglasses that have more width than depth;
narrow oval glasses are an excellent choice.

_ _

###  Oval Face

The oval face shape is considered to be the ideal shape because of its
balanced proportions. The oval face is neither curvalinear nor angular. Your
goal should be to keep the oval's natural balance. Look for glasses frames
that are as wide as, or wider than, the broadest part of the face. Look for
almond or walnut-shaped glasses frames that are neither too deep nor too
narrow so that they do not upset facial balance.

_ _

###  Oblong Face

The oblong face shape is longer than it is wide and is characterized by a
long, straight cheek line and sometimes a longer nose Your goal should be to
make the face appear shorter and more balanced. Look for glasses frames that
have top-to-bottom depth such as rounder panto or P-3 shapes; decorative or
contrasting temples that can add width to the face; a low bridge to shorten
the nose.

_ _

###  Diamond Face Shape

Diamond-shaped faces are narrow at the eyeline and the jawline - cheekbones
are frequently high and dramatic. The diamond is the rarest face shape. Your
goal should be to highlight the eyes and bring out the cheekbones. Look for
glasses frames that have detailing or distinctive browlines. Rimless frames,
ovals or cat-eyes are all excellent choices.

_ _

###  Base-Up Triangle Face Shape

_ _ The base-up triangle face shape has a very wide top third and small bottom
third. Your goal should be to minimize the width of the top half of the face.
Look for glasses frames that are wider at the bottom half of the frame. Very
light colored and materials are effective, and rimless styles are an excellent
choice.

##  
Adjusting Eyeglasses

To  adjust  glasses frames, it is helpful to know all about  frame parts  .
Glasses frames are designed to be adjusted in many different ways. You can
make some adjustments at home, but take great care, and read our article

###  Basic Eyeglasses Types

half-rim,  rimless eyeglasses  , and shield. For additional information, read
our article on  eyeglasses types  . We always recommend  UV protection  for

###  **Eyeglasses Materials**

Eyeglasses are made in a variety of materials, from high quality  titanium  to
vinyl. If you want to learn more, read our article on  eyeglasses frame
materials.  Some eyeglasses are made with titanium which is super light, but
sometimes brittle in cold weather. For the lens, we always recommend  anti
reflective coating  on eyewear.

indestructible polycarbonate material.

##  **Vision Insurance Companies **

For prescription eyewear brands and accessories, we accept vision plans from
many of the leading providers such as United Health Care,  VSP  ,  Blue Cross
Blue Shield  ,  Eyemed  , and many more. The same goes for your HSA/FSA
dollars, which you can use to reduce the costs of your eyewear. Your personal
benefits information can be determined by calling your insurer; California
residents can meet additional eligibility criteria.

##  How to Use Your Vision Insurance Benefits

Insurance providers for eyewear brands range from supplemental vision benefits
plans offered by your employer, to independent plans that users with a vision
impaired profile can purchase outside of your employer's plan. In most cases,
you can get your eye exams in-network from an eye doctor focused on your eye
health, and your insurance provider will offer an out of network benefit for
your eyewear.

Once users have submitted their personal information and confirmed their
insurance eligibility, you can submit the claim form directly to your
insurance provider. To obtain insurance benefits after your eye exam, there
will be a valid prescription required, your birth date, and a valid zip code
required. Unfortunately, when you try to use your vision insurance at most
optical stores, you will never have zero hidden fees, because prescription
eyewear is how they make their profit.

A regular visit to an eye care professional is important for all people, but
especially for patients with tunnel vision, visual impairment, cognitive
disabilities, degrading eyesight, accessibility issues, and any other vision
problem.

##  **Out of Network Benefits **

Contact your insurance company to find out how to use your out of network
benefits for your pair of eyewear to get the best vision. Most vision
