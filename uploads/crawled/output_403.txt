#  Ralph Glasses

Ralph glasses are a collection made by  Ralph Lauren  , a brand that is
recognized throughout the world. Ralph Lauren glasses found their beginning 40
years ago with a collection of men’s ties. His Polo Ralph Lauren eyewear brand
has since grown into an iconic design philosophy that redefines an American
style that reflects a sense of timeless luxury. This design philosophy extends
throughout not only in Ralph Lauren’s glasses fashion lines for men, women,
and children, but also in their home décor that encompasses table top, bedding
and bath products. For more than 30 years, the reputation and distinctive
images of the Ralph Lauren life style have been consistently developed across
an expanding number of products, brands and international markets. The essence
and personality of  Ralph eyewear  is translated into everything that this
leading designer produces including  Ralph Lauren  glasses for men and women.
According to the designer, “Style is very personal. It has nothing to do with
fashion. Fashion is over quickly. Style is forever.” All Ralph glasses and
most  Ralph sunglasses  can be customized with  **prescription lenses** , just
like all of our  glasses  . ...  Read More
