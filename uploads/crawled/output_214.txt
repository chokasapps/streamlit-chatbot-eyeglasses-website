#  Fossil Glasses

Fossil glasses come from the heart and soul of the FOSSIL  brand  – its
people, products and culture. Fossil (and Fossil glasses) is about a unique
kind of inspired creativity. At Fossil, fashion meets technology, and purpose
meets impact. Representing the concept of accessible cool, Fossil’s identity
is anchored in vintage authentic style mixed with a creative spirit and a
sense of humor that extends into all its product offerings, including glasses.
Fossil glasses are the invention of the Fossil brand, which has carefully
built a worldwide designer reputation for stylish quality and fashionable
craftsmanship. The popular glasses collection takes advantage of its heritage
with some classic frame styles but it also winks at a new contemporary
dynamism. Fossil glasses are the ideal choice for men or women with a self-
confident attitude who know what they want. Fossil glasses and  Fossil ****
sunglasses  can all be customized with  **prescription lenses** , just like
all of our  glasses  .
