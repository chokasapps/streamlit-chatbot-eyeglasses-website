#  Easytwist Eyeglasses

EasyTwist glasses are a major improvement over the out-dated nickel-titanium
flexible material commonly used in other eyewear lines. This new state-of-the-
art technology uses Trilaston, a nickel-free, copper-based alloy rich in
aluminum. If you are allergic to nickel, these frames may be a solution for
you. EasyTwist glasses frames out perform other flexible frame because they
are more flexible, easily adjustable, and always recover their shape.
