##  Ray Ban RB5228C Glasses

###

  * Made of metal, the eyewear frame can be easily adjusted for a perfect fit with your prescription lenses. Your Ray Ban purchase includes free standard shipping charges, and manufacturer packaging. You can add doctor verified prescription lenses, add custom polarized lenses, and many other lens options if you desire them. Like all Ray Ban products, these eyeglasses frames provide the sophisticated and classic look that we all need. 
  * Ray Ban RB5228C eyeglass frame features a trendy rectangle shape, which helps to balance rounded face features. Frame shape is the most noticeable feature of a pair of glasses, followed by frame colors and frame size. Top brands always have a large collection of rectangle frame shape glasses, as well as oval frame shape glasses. 
  * Ray Ban RB5228C frames feature a fashionable full frame design, which is the largest component of designer eyeglasses brands collections. A rim all the way around the lenses, provides for maximum stability and durability. 

This is the Clip On attachment for the  Ray Ban Glasses RX5228  and  Ray Ban
Glasses RX5228F Asian Fit
